On Monday we listened to the Cox Auto 1Q 2023 Industry Insights call. Slide 27 of the presentation deck, based on Kelley Blue Book sales data gathered from state Registry of Motor Vehicle data, shows an estimated 8,145 newly registered vehicles for RIVN in 1Q23, vs the consensus estimate of 7,161 vehicle deliveries. We also update our used vehicle tracking data for RIVN and Lucid (LCID, rated Buy). We view the data positively for RIVN, as we find fewer used RIVN vehicles for sale vs LCID and vs Ford's F-150 Lightning pick-up truck, a more direct comp vs the RIVN R1T.","RIVN"

"2023-05-23 20:50:52+00:00","California pushes Biden Admin to ban sales of new gas-vehicles by 2035 $TSLA $BLNK, $CHPT, $F, $GM, $LCID, $PSNY, $RIVN  According to an exclusive report from Reuters on Tuesday, California's Air Resources Board (CARB) has asked the Biden administration to give the green light to a plan that would require all new vehicles sold in the state by 2035 to be either electric or plug-in electric hybrids. This landmark move, mentioned in a letter seen by Reuters, could help hasten the phase-out of gasoline-powered vehicles. ""These vehicles will permanently displace emissions from conventional vehicles,"" wrote CARB Executive Officer Steven Cliff, adding that motor vehicles and other mobile sources are the greatest source of emissions in California. California's new emission rules aim to slash smog-causing pollution from light-duty vehicles by 25% by 2037. According to these rules, by 2026, at least 35% of newly sold cars must be plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), electric vehicles (EVs), or hydrogen fuel cell-powered. This requirement will steadily rise to 68% by 2030 and eventually reach a full 100% by 2035. EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll said ""as with all waiver requests from California, we‚Äôll follow an open public process in considering it, as the agency routinely does."" However, the Biden administration had repeatedly avoided placing a time limit on phasing out gas-powered cars. More and more states are embracing California's electric vehicle regulations, which are stricter than the proposals put forth by the Biden administration. In recent weeks, Rhode Island joined the ranks of Washington, Virginia, Vermont, Oregon, New York, and Massachusetts by adopting the same stringent requirements set by California.","RIVN"

"2023-05-24 13:04:54+00:00","The worst stock on the S&P 500 from a balance sheet perspective is Rivian Automotive. $rivn Rivian has a negative cash flow from operations of $4.236 billion and a negative free cash flow of $4.236 billion. This means that the company is burning through cash and is not generating enough revenue to cover its expenses. Rivian also has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 1.43, which means that it is using more debt to finance its operations than equity. This makes the company more vulnerable to financial distress if its cash flow problems worsen.","RIVN"
