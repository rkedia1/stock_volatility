Corp. strategy is all over the map, and now relying on a new CEO. Still focused heavily on hybrid tech and w/ each passing month falls further behind in the optimal tech (full BEV). TM subsidiary Woven Planet bought Lyft's autonomy unit in '21...minimal updates since $F - laying off ~4k employees in EU and just publicly admitted to billions of dollars of inefficiences at the company. EV's are not yet profitable and said they won't be until '25. Corp. strategy is clear (full BEV push), but absurd amount of work and change ahead. Shut down autonomy efforts with Argo AI $GM - we give Mary a hard time (for good reason), but at least their corp. strategy is heavily focused on full BEV's w/ Ultium despite still investing in V8. They'll need ICE profits to ease the transition to EV's. Not breaking any EV production/sales records, but they have a strong pipeline announced and are taking the methodical approach with the üîã JV with LG and its modular platform. Cruise still can't be seen via a telescope by Tesla, but relative to non-Tesla peers it's farther along w/ autonomy $LCID - recent earnings were not great, guidance was even worse. If they don't get cost control handled soon a Saudi PIF buyout may be the only way out. I think they should have started with a luxury SUV rather than sedan. They make nice cars but as we always say, the game is who can make nice cars *at a profit*. So far that list is VERY small $RIVN - just laid off 6% of its workforce. Rivian was wise in starting in a sandbox Tesla was not playing in (pickup, commercial) and has a strong adventure niche. Commercial deal with $AMZN will help through recession. Despite this, there are still no guarantees they will exist in 10 years as the road to profitability will be challenging. I like their chances though $TSLA - making millions of EV's *profitably* at margins the rest of the industry dreams of. Creating its own üîã without a JV taking profits. So far ahead of the rest autonomously it's not even worth discussing (IMO). About to DRASTICALLY increase TAM w/ Cybertruck, Semi and generation 3 platform. Tesla Energy season is here and Megapack has nearly unlimited TAM. I could go on but most of us already get the picture  Tesla is in a league of its own and Wall St. analysts that like to quibble over a few margin bps here and there are wildly missing the bigger picture. @elonmusk - thank you for making my investment decisions so easy üòÇ"
