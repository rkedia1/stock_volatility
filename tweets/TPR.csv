I'm leaving out the positive commentary, but I sense a trend. @CourtReagan @cherylcasone  $TPR: ""results in the third quarter were better than expected, although the trends did soften as the quarter progressed and that continued into April. The backdrop is increasingly challenging, and we are seeing a more cautious consumer."" $TCS: ""When we look at the cadence of the quarter, the first couple of months were relatively consistent. We really saw a drop off. We were experiencing lower traffic volumes...We saw a notable decline in that during the month of March, and we continue to see that in the month of April"" $TGT: ""consumer spending patterns continue to evolve, putting significant pressure on our discretionary categories."" $WMT: ""...we saw a moderation as we went through the quarter, February was stronger and March and April were a bit of a tick down. And that follows some of the trends that we saw and other consumer behavior related to like SNAP benefits, tax refunds, and such."" $FL: ""...our sales have since softened meaningfully given the tough macroeconomic backdrop, causing us to reduce our guidance for the year as we take more aggressive markdowns to both drive demand and manage inventory."""
