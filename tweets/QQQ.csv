Not only do we have a loaded crowd of pessimists, we also have a crowd that‚Äôs wound up on hitting checkbox‚Äôs of things that NEED to happen to confirm the ‚Äúend of the bear‚Äù. What this did was create a whole new generation of perma-bears (PB‚Äôs). Once the market turns around, they will likely be unable to see the shifts in front of their eyes. As PB‚Äôs do, they will fight until it‚Äôs obvious and if they‚Äôre lucky they‚Äôll flow with the trend. If not, they become ‚Äúlost souls‚Äù."

Everything is pointing towards a move lower, BUT the price action is very clear, we are soaking and holding on each dip (so far).  If banks stabilize and the interest rate swaps (expectations for interest rates) do not budge, it does make for a compelling case for a move higher.  We talked about this 2 weeks ago already and markets are so far at least reacting accordingly.  A classical case of bad news = good news which most could mistake as a bearish event.  (They are not fully wrong as a deeper banking crisis would be very bad, however this is not where we are now.)  Explanation: Bonds yields topped in an extreme manner and we finally have a reason that could make the FED and ECB pivot ('could', not should). On top we have the FED balance sheet growing again week after week, no matter if inflationary or not and if direct or not, this is not tightening conditions."

It just feels like NOTHING can bring this stock market down at the moment. Which is very much THE reason why it can and will pullback some. When you feel so invincible, the markets have a way to bring you back down to Earth... I think the 2nd half (July-Sept) of this year will be rocky. Not a crash (-30%), not even a revisit of a bear market (-20%), but more a correction which is a ~10% drop give or take. The meat on the bone here at 4,300 SPX is little to none imho (Though I did say that at 4,200, so clown me). I'm forecasting a drop to 3,900 SPX no lower than 3,800 within the next 3 months before we get our eoy ""Santa Claus"" rally back to 4,200ish and close it right there to begin perhaps a more bullish 2024.
