11772,2023-04-10 19:09:47+00:00,"Let me tell you what this AMC/ APE 10:1 reverse split really is  $AMC reached an ATH of $72 off buying pressure alone, confirmed by the GameStop $GME report released by the @SECGov, there was no covering. All those shorts never got closed.  The buy button was taken away to stop buying pressure making sure the stock couldn’t keep increased in price. Without buying pressure, the only price movement would be from shorting driving the price down. The buy button is still removed thanks to payment for order flow because this allows Wall Street to purchase all our orders and send them off exchange / through dark pools to be processed. So nothings changed, we still get no buying pressure and shorts can algorithmically control the price down to the penny  We have tested this theory in the past where we all saved up and bought on the same day, sometimes as much as 200 million in volume and the price finished the same price as when we started the day. What they can’t feed into their algorithms to keep the price within range they simple “park” the order for another day. They also mark large buy orders as neutral so we get no buying pressure $APE was supposed to accomplish the same goal as a dividend, it would give us a share count. When Germany stopped trading #APE due to not being able to locate, proving counterfeits the SEC @FINRA @The_DTCC & @CEOAdam did not do anything about it. So there is no point in pretending a dividend is the end game, it’s not. Some share holders never even received their shares & @Fidelity even said they weren’t locating when issuing shares. This means there could have been infinite counterfeits  APE & AMC stock was driven down thanks to off exchange/ dark pools & naked/ predatory shorting. APE FTDs kept piling up in the 10s of millions then they would magically disappear, the same happens to AMC. Somehow the stocks show up on the threshold securities list and then POOF they’re just removed without any covering that would have allowed them to be removed, we never see it in the volume & we never get buying pressure  Why would Adam wait to sell APE to Antera at the all time low of $0.66 instead of right away if the goal with to eliminate debt? He could have made way more money if he had sold right away at the higher price… He needs the YES vote, he sold  APE “YES votes” at an all time low of $0.66, right after the vote took place Antera dumped their APE shares. This is confirmation, there’s no other reason they’d do that. You see the stock has been driven down so much by fraud he needs to attract new investors to buy at a higher price, thus paying off debt. To do that he wants to do a reverse split.  #AMC share price will increase 10x, you will lose 90% of your shares & then he will dilute to sell shares at the higher price to pay off debt. What happens next? The same fraud that drove AMC down from $72 -> $4. This reverse is asking shareholders to open themselves up to another 90% loss so that Adam can TEMPORARILY sell shares to pay off debt at a higher prices. It’s temporarily because nothing has changed in market fairness so we know the same fraud will drive the price back down.  We also know with a new CUSIP number all the fraud dies with the old CUSIP numbers so now all of their fraud will be wiped clean, retail holders will have their holdings decrease by 90% making us not the majority holders anymore, giving the stock back to Wall Street This reverse split is armageddon & MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH",GME,-0.9686

11892,2023-04-19 13:38:29+00:00,"Never in our stock market's history have their been so many eyeballs on so many controversies playing out in real time, all at once. Whether your story is tied to $GTII $MMTLP $GNS $CLNV $DBMM $GME $AAPJ etc, it's part of a much bigger revolution taking place. Naked shorts have abused the system for decades, especially targeting distressed companies and helping cement their demise. What's beautiful though is that there is a paradigm shift taking place and it's changing all of that, and the way we win and the naked shorts lose is through exposure. Every win for any of these tickers is a win for the greater good. The more the retail market can band together, the more exposure they can put on this story and the more pressure is put on the shorts. Everyone needs to keep fighting their fight, but also appreciate how this is all tied to a cancer in our financial markets. I firmly believe we are in the early stages of a huge revolution of sorts and we will see sweeping changes before it's all said and done. If you don't think the bad guys can ever lose because nothing has ever been done about this, you're missing the bigger picture. This was allowed to go on because there never was enough exposure to drastically change such a deeply embedded problem, but over time the problems built up as did the evidence against them and the amount of awareness of retail investors. Now the awareness is clearly going exponential, and this will only become more and more talked about. The other reason I know this will all come crumbling down for the naked shorts is because there's way too much money to be made on the other side of this trade, after decades of building up catastrophic risk exposure. There will be no shortage of big players looking to take full advantage of their greediness and shortsightedness. The key will be to stay patient and to remember that any positive development for any of these naked shorted plays is a victory for retail as a whole, and the more awareness you spread about the ticker you're attached to is more awareness of the bigger picture, which is a retail revolution in the making.",GME,-0.8358

Right so hear me out. We all love to shill #Altcoins this and that but as these companies take more of your rights away, make more money and steal more of the pie what are you left with?  Games like @TOPIAgg using $WRLD who was actively rugged by @Microsoft (now getting into blockchain tech 🫠 who openly called it a scam cough cough)  I wonder if there will ever be a day when the users & players get pissed enough to start boycotting and doing a full switch… Now I think the tech will be impressive enough to make them want to switch but I’m talking about massive exchange of users + $$$$  People complain about having no freedom but as these games @ValeriaStudios @illuviumio @Pixelmon and others roll out allowing the users to have ownership and operate what is going to happen? Web 2 gamers are going to continue to support these corporations who have fleeced them for Billions and Billions of dollars? Honestly, maybe they will because use humans are stupid greedy pigs at the end of the day  But I really wonder  $APE $WRLD  $VALS  Others that will come  When do these tokens go on an absolute gangbuster run because people realize change is coming?

12231,2023-05-14 16:37:22+00:00,"What in the actual funk is going on with $AAPJ? In a market with an ever-growing list of stocks revealing just how wide and blatant the counterfeit share selling truly is ( $MMTLP, $GME, $DBMM, $GTII, etc) this one is right up there with those. Just look at these facts below and infer from them what you will: -According to the most recent filing, the public float is 22 million -I personally own 18 million and easily know other holding more than 4 million (ie I can personally attest to more than the float being held by retail longs) -Jan 17 - 19 saw 56 million FTDs, not only more FTDs than I've ever seen in such a short time frame (in both nominal and portion of float or O/S) but also clearly way more than are supposedly in the public float So that begs the question, how and why could there be that many FTDs on such a small public float? The only reason for shorts to short so heavily is if they believed that the float was going to be increased enough to easily cover (or better for them never have to cover), which it was reasonable to believe that back in early January because the company had a big fat ugly toxic convertible note on the books. But then in late January, after the 56 million FTDs were officially posted, the company canceled said note and fast forward to now and the public float is still way to small to save the shorts.  The company recently announced purchasing real estate assets worth $1.6 million and if you look at the filing the two 23.5 million share blocks they issued went to a realtor named Vince Sbarra. My guess is the last 15 million or so also went to him, which puts the acquisition at about 62 million shares for the $1.6 million in real estate assets (somewhere around .025 per share. My take is that Vince knows damn well that he is locking up the last 62 million shares of a very tight float and with total control between a small group of people, they're holding a perfect vehicle for massive growth. I don't just want .025 per share here, all the writing on the wall is telling me that even .025 is cheap and the sky is the limit here. Going back to my first line here, I have no clue what the heck is going on here but just based on all of the known info here, I think this is a monster squeeze play with management putting the final touches on it.",GME,0.9907

The deal will link Web3 games utilizing Telos' decentralized blockchain infrastructure to GameStop’s upcoming Web3 game launchpad Playr, providing new opportunities for mainstream gaming distribution. AJ Dinger, head of business development at the Telos Foundation, said in a press release that the collaboration will help onboard new users to the Web3 gaming ecosystem using Telos’ robust network. ""We believe this collaboration will be a meaningful driver of new users into the Web3 space,” said Dinger. “By combining GameStop Playr with Web3 games utilizing Telos' high-performance blockchain infrastructure, we can break down many of the barriers currently deterring Web2 players from embracing Web3."" Telos’ native token TLOS jumped 10% on the news before receding. GameStop has steadily been moving away from its brick and mortar strategy to focus on a digital expansion that includes Web3 gaming. In February 2022, it announced a partnership with layer 1 blockchain Immutable X to build a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace for trading in-game assets. The marketplace, which has been operating as a public beta since July, officially launced to the public in October 2022. The retailer also released its self-custodial crypto and NFT wallet in May 2022.",GME,0.9124

I wish I'd kept track of the number of times I've been in a dialogue with a cartoon animal profile picture, trying to hunt down the misunderstanding leading them to believe that a fiat coin ran by Vitalik's band of nerds and 🦄🦄🦄🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈 marketing is any better than one ran by Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve 9 times out of 10, rather than digest the information I hand to them (or god forbid read The Bitcoin Standard as I've recommended countless times) they simply eject themselves from the conversation with ""crypto is good and bitcoin is bad because RC says so"", and proudly unfollow/block me for questioning their lord and savior. Guys, this leader-dependent process of thinking is not going to get you where you want to be this decade. I know it feels good to have that mighty leader to follow; we all grew up idolizing these great & powerful figures who embody the values we believe in, who we can look to to solve our problems so we don't need to.
