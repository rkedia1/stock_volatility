Furthermore, their revenue outlook for the upcoming quarter exceeded estimates. ‚Ä¢ I mentioned this in my newsletter last week Lululemon $LULU up 12% as the athletic apparel retailer beat fiscal first-quarter earnings expectations and increased its full-year guidance Dollar General $DG down 20% due to disappointing first-quarter earnings and revenue. The company also decreased its full-year outlook, attributing this to a tougher macroeconomic climate than initially anticipated. Chewy $CHWY up 25% after the pet retailer reported a surprise earnings beat, exceeded revenue expectations, and provided a bullish second-quarter revenue outlook. C3 .ai $AI down 14% due to a weaker-than-expected outlook overshadowing its better-than-expected earnings for the previous quarter. Lucid $LCID down 14% after the luxury EV maker announced a $3 billion stock offering. A significant portion of this amount, $1.8 billion, will come from a private placement with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which owns approximately 60% of Lucid. CrowdStrike $CRWD down 2% after the cybersecurity firm's quarterly results showed decelerating revenue growth, indicating potential concerns about its future growth trajectory.
