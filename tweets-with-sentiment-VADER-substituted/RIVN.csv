"2023-05-16 13:18:47+00:00","Besides the stpositiveid political noise around Soros it is remarkable to look at his Q1/23 investment actions. Because actions speak louder than words. He significantly reduced stakes in companies contributing to sustainable energy and transport namely e.g. Rivian $RIVN, Piedmont Lithium $PLL and famously wiping his Tesla $TSLA position, which he actually had just extended in Q4/22. Also several other big and small western tech companies are amongst the cuts. Looking at the positions he built, striking is the new addition of $FXI, a China large cap ETF, which contains some of the worst current polluters and companies closely affiliated to the PRC givernment, which he usually had been very vocal about criticising publicly, also targeting investors who are active in China.

This landmark move, mentioned in a letter seen by Reuters, could help hasten the phasenegative out of gasolinenegative powered vehicles. ""These vehicles will permanently displace emissions from conventional vehicles,"" wrote CARB Executive Officer Steven Cliff, adding that motor vehicles and other mobile sources are the greatest source of emissions in California. California's new emission rules aim to slash smognegative causing pollution from lightnegative duty vehicles by 25% by 2037. According to these rules, by 2026, at least 35% of newly sold cars must be plugnegative in hybrid electric (PHEV), electric vehicles (EVs), or hydrogen fuel cellnegative powered. This requirement will steadily rise to 68% by 2030 and eventually reach a full 100% by 2035. EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll said ""as with all waiver requests from California, we‚Äôll follow an open public process in considering it, as the agency routinely does."" However, the Biden administration had repeatedly avoided placing a time limit on phasing out gasnegative powered cars. More and more states are embracing California's electric vehicle regulations, which are stricter than the proposals negative forth by the Biden administration. In recent weeks, Rhode Island joined the ranks of Washington, Virginia, Vermont, Oregon, New York, and Massachusetts by adopting the same stringent requirements set by California.","RIVN",-0.4588
