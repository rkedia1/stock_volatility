Tesla's price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share.

Musk has unleashed a price war in China. Musk has also slashed Tesla prices in the U.S., forcing rivals to follow suit. Ford, for example, this week announced price cuts for the Mustang Machnegative E, the bestselling EV last year not built by Tesla. That marked the second time this year that Ford cuts costs after Tesla did so.

The parts, made by Knoxville, Tennesseenegative based ARC Automotive Inc., should be immediately repositiveed, the agency said in a letter to the company posted online Friday.

This landmark move, mentioned in a letter seen by Reuters, could help hasten the phasenegative out of gasolinenegative powered vehicles. ""These vehicles will permanently displace emissions from conventional vehicles,"" wrote CARB Executive Officer Steven Cliff, adding that motor vehicles and other mobile sources are the greatest source of emissions in California. California's new emission rules aim to slash smognegative causing pollution from lightnegative duty vehicles by 25% by 2037. According to these rules, by 2026, at least 35% of newly sold cars must be plugnegative in hybrid electric (PHEV), electric vehicles (EVs), or hydrogen fuel cellnegative powered. This requirement will steadily rise to 68% by 2030 and eventually reach a full 100% by 2035. EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll said ""as with all waiver requests from California, we’ll follow an open public process in considering it, as the agency routinely does."" However, the Biden administration had repeatedly avoided placing a time limit on phasing out gasnegative powered cars. More and more states are embracing California's electric vehicle regulations, which are stricter than the proposals negative forth by the Biden administration. In recent weeks, Rhode Island joined the ranks of Washington, Virginia, Vermont, Oregon, New York, and Massachusetts by adopting the same stringent requirements set by California.","F",-0.4588

"2023-06-09 11:40:40+00:00","$GM follows $F and adopts $TSLA charging standard.  Observations and Predictions ... (1) I suspect that other car manufacturers will follow suit. Why would they not? The car industry is changing rapidly, and cashflows will not be prioritised towards a successful transition to EVs. Tesla foresaw the issues surrounding charging EVs and built a comprehensive network that works far better than standalone providers such as Electrify America $EVGO and ChargePoint $CHPT. I'm predicting Stellantis $STLA will be the next to follow suit, and then a cascade of other car manufacturers. (2) This will not be a massive boon for Tesla regarding the monetary value, but it will open the door for future licensing and collaboration. Selfnegative driving software and Chips are the most obvious that come to mind. Again, I ponder the question negative  In the face of watching your old business and cash cow dwindle, it will be challenging to transition to profitable EVs, which the likes of $GM and $F have mentioned won't happen for years to come, if you have to divert funds to extended areas of development AND in a relatively negative period. It will be far more accessible and capital efficient to license technology from a company that has been laying the foundation and pioneering for over a decade. (3) Shareholder implications negative  There is no doubt this is great for sentiment, and in the negative term, this can significantly affect the stock price. Narratives and stories can push a stock beyond disbelief, and optimists will argue and defend the rise, whilst pessimists will scorn the same. I'm not discuss either way; however, these developments push back on the argument that the 'competition is coming' and 'it will be easy to catch positive'. The more licensing and collaboration announcements, the more Tesla is being cemented as a leader in this technology. https://t.co/A0u6viRLOv","F",-0.8519
