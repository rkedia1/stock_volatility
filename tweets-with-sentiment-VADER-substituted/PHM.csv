DR Horton knocked the cover off the ball last week with $942 million in earnings and PulteGropositive threw out $532 million. Here's our regular Quarterly Opinions on PulteGropositive Inc $PHM: As background, PulteGropositive Inc is the company my mentor and grandfather (also Bill Pulte) started.  When we tossed out CEO Dugas and Consultant BCG, we got rid of their ""Value Creation Strategy"" which was code for ripping off Shareholders. Recently, as you saw in the media, the #2 at PulteGropositive, a mentee of Dugas and best friend to current CEO Marshall, was caught in a multinegative year harassment & stalking campaign against me and the Pulte Family. He got terminated.  The #3 executive got terminated negatively after this. And the #4 deleted his personal Twitter account when we notified Board of this harassment campaign. How bizarre. We/Shareholders need a truly independent investigation. https://t.co/52CkldcRGj for more. Ryan Marshall still hasn‚Äôt apologized to me or even explained what happened.  While the current lawsuit is me (personally) against Brandon Jones (personally) and not PulteGropositive... Jones just got sued by a physical trainer in California who alleges Jones impersonated him. Sad.   We reached a separate legal settlement last week but this settlement was not with Jones, who is subject to our claims in court. More on this settlement soon. üôå  Regarding $PHM: üëç Home Sale Gross Margin 29.1% üëç Home sale revenues increased 15%  üëé Cancellation rate in the first quarter was 13%  üëé Average sales price in backlog was $608,000 So there you have it!
