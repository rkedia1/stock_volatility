"2023-05-13 23:32:04+00:00","Reasons to go negative on $cmg:  Competitive pressure: Chipotle faces intense competition from other fastnegative casual chains and traditional fastnegative food restaurants. The market is crowded and highly competitive, which could limit Chipotle's ability to grow sales and profits. Food safety concerns: Chipotle has struggled with food safety issues in the past, including outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella, and norovirus. Any future incidents could damage the company's renegativeation and hurt sales. Rising food costs: The cost of food ingredients is a significant expense for Chipotle, and any increase in food costs could eat into the company's margins and profits. Labor costs: Chipotle has faced criticism for its labor practices, including low wages and limited benefits for workers. If the company faces pressure to increase wages or benefits, it could hurt profitability. Dependence on the U.S. market: Chipotle generates the majority of its revenue in the United States. If the company is unable to expand internationally, it could limit its growth potential and leave it vulnerable to changes in the U.S. economy. Valuation: Chipotle's stock price is relatively expensive compared to its earnings and revenue growth. If investors become more cautious and start to sell highnegative growth stocks, Chipotle's valuation could come under pressure.","CMG",0.8658

They are always claiming they will be profitable so there always seems to be a forward PE, just never happens under the current CEO.  At 52 week highs.  No profit = 52 week highs going into a restaurant (and retail) traffic decline? $SG not profitable and don't be surprised when they talk AI just to get a stock boost apositive with touting their machine run restaurant.  They've been hit already so being careful  I'd much rather be positive....it's more fun to be positive and easier to profit on the positive side.
