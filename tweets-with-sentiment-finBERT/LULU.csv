Chewy $CHWY up 25% after the pet retailer reported a surprise earnings beat, exceeded revenue expectations, and provided a bullish second-quarter revenue outlook.

Victoria‚Äôs Secret $VSCO down 8% after the company missed earnings and revenue targets. They also downgraded their full-year revenue guidance.
