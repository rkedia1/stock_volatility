First, Ferrari has an incredibly strong brand based on exclusivity and prestige, and I believe that Ferrari‚Äôs brand prestige will carry over to EVs. Secondly, in my view, Ferrari doesn‚Äôt have to worry much about two common challenges with EVs, affordability and range. Ferrari makes luxury cars, so they don‚Äôt have to focus on finding a way to make an affordable EV. Likewise, Ferraris probably aren‚Äôt many owners‚Äô first choice for long road trips, so Ferrari isn‚Äôt going to have to necessarily have the most range on the market. Also, Ferrari can afford to use lightweight materials and, since Ferrari makes sports cars, they can focus on making their EVs very aerodynamic, both of which can help to boost range.
