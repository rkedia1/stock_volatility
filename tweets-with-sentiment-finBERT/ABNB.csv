I believe social media is helping to promote greater interest in traveling among younger generations. Essentially, I think people are seeing images of friends and celebrities taking trips and subsequently becoming inspired to travel themselves. 2. I believe the growth of the middle class in emerging markets will lead to more people having the financial resources to travel. 3. I think AI, such as autonomous vehicles, will make travel easier and subsequently lead to more trips being taken. Why I‚Äôm Bullish on Airbnb 1. I believe Airbnb benefits significantly from the network effect. 2. I think Airbnb has the potential to generate a lot of free cash flow due to having an asset light business model that should allow them to continue to grow efficiently while boosting margins. 3. Airbnb has a wide variety of types of listings which allows them to appeal to a wide audience, from solo budget travels to large families looking for elaborate accommodations.
