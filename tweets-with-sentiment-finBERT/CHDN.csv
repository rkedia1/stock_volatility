Note that many mega and large market cap stocks, like $AAPL and $GOOGL, have made one or more forward splits to their stocks when the stock price has grown ""too expensive"" for the public. Once the price decreases after a split, there is a higher chance that more investors will buy shares again, boosting the price further in the future. If you find a stock making a forward split, you might have good stock in your hands. Check the price chart, business and financials to verify the future growth potential.
