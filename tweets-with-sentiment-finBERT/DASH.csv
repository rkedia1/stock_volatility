Operationally, I still do not see how they can fix this without replacing their employees with AI chat bots.   For years, it seems the winner of the 3P wars will be the one that is able to fire all their staff and use AI instead...still seems that's the only way, but it must be done with finesse.   When they start firing and going AI, it will put another target on them for anti-trust issues.  Siphoning all this money from the economy while not being a job creator will raise even the loosest of anti-trust monitors.   3P are mostly marketing companies with endless amounts of money to force themselves into a traditionally 2 person transaction, forcing the cost higher on consumers.   If they did not have the endless amounts of money that they do, they would not be able to force themselves into the transaction, disrupting it.  üëâüëâ The Money is the disruptor, not the tech.
