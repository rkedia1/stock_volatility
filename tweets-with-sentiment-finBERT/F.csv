The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration identified at least nine cases of ruptured air bag inflators that led to injuries, including two deaths, dating from 2009 to as recently as this past March. The parts, made by Knoxville, Tennessee-based ARC Automotive Inc., should be immediately recalled, the agency said in a letter to the company posted online Friday. The air bags are used by at least a dozen car manufacturers, including General Motors Co., Stellantis NV, Volkswagen AG and Hyundai Motor Co.

This landmark move, mentioned in a letter seen by Reuters, could help hasten the phase-out of gasoline-powered vehicles. ""These vehicles will permanently displace emissions from conventional vehicles,"" wrote CARB Executive Officer Steven Cliff, adding that motor vehicles and other mobile sources are the greatest source of emissions in California. California's new emission rules aim to slash smog-causing pollution from light-duty vehicles by 25% by 2037. According to these rules, by 2026, at least 35% of newly sold cars must be plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), electric vehicles (EVs), or hydrogen fuel cell-powered. This requirement will steadily rise to 68% by 2030 and eventually reach a full 100% by 2035. EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll said ""as with all waiver requests from California, we‚Äôll follow an open public process in considering it, as the agency routinely does."" However, the Biden administration had repeatedly avoided placing a time limit on phasing out gas-powered cars. More and more states are embracing California's electric vehicle regulations, which are stricter than the proposals put forth by the Biden administration. In recent weeks, Rhode Island joined the ranks of Washington, Virginia, Vermont, Oregon, New York, and Massachusetts by adopting the same stringent requirements set by California.",0.1293274313211441,0.035378001630306244,0.8352946043014526

"F","2023-06-09 11:40:40+00:00","$GM follows $F and adopts $TSLA charging standard.  Observations and Predictions ... (1) I suspect that other car manufacturers will follow suit. Why would they not? The car industry is changing rapidly, and cashflows will not be prioritised towards a successful transition to EVs. Tesla foresaw the issues surrounding charging EVs and built a comprehensive network that works far better than standalone providers such as Electrify America $EVGO and ChargePoint $CHPT. I'm predicting Stellantis $STLA will be the next to follow suit, and then a cascade of other car manufacturers. (2) This will not be a massive boon for Tesla regarding the monetary value, but it will open the door for future licensing and collaboration. Self-driving software and Chips are the most obvious that come to mind. Again, I ponder the question - In the face of watching your old business and cash cow dwindle, it will be challenging to transition to profitable EVs, which the likes of $GM and $F have mentioned won't happen for years to come, if you have to divert funds to extended areas of development AND in a relatively short period. It will be far more accessible and capital efficient to license technology from a company that has been laying the foundation and pioneering for over a decade. (3) Shareholder implications - There is no doubt this is great for sentiment, and in the short term, this can significantly affect the stock price. Narratives and stories can push a stock beyond disbelief, and bulls will argue and defend the rise, whilst bears will scorn the same. I'm not discuss either way; however, these developments push back on the argument that the 'competition is coming' and 'it will be easy to catch up'. The more licensing and collaboration announcements, the more Tesla is being cemented as a leader in this technology. https://t.co/A0u6viRLOv",0.2880729138851166,0.01834951527416706,0.6935775279998779
