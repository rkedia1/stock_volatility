This landmark move, mentioned in a letter seen by Reuters, could help hasten the phase-out of gasoline-powered vehicles. ""These vehicles will permanently displace emissions from conventional vehicles,"" wrote CARB Executive Officer Steven Cliff, adding that motor vehicles and other mobile sources are the greatest source of emissions in California. California's new emission rules aim to slash smog-causing pollution from light-duty vehicles by 25% by 2037. According to these rules, by 2026, at least 35% of newly sold cars must be plug-in hybrid electric (PHEV), electric vehicles (EVs), or hydrogen fuel cell-powered. This requirement will steadily rise to 68% by 2030 and eventually reach a full 100% by 2035. EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll said ""as with all waiver requests from California, we‚Äôll follow an open public process in considering it, as the agency routinely does."" However, the Biden administration had repeatedly avoided placing a time limit on phasing out gas-powered cars. More and more states are embracing California's electric vehicle regulations, which are stricter than the proposals put forth by the Biden administration. In recent weeks, Rhode Island joined the ranks of Washington, Virginia, Vermont, Oregon, New York, and Massachusetts by adopting the same stringent requirements set by California.",0.1293274313211441,0.035378001630306244,0.8352946043014526
