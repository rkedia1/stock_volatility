"CCL","2023-04-11 13:27:03+00:00","At the start of the pandemic, $CCL fell roughly 86%   & its annual revenues dropped from $5.59B to a low of $1.90B in just 1 year. But after its Q1 2023 earnings, $CCL could be one of the best plays this summer. Here's why 👇 $CCL revenues have been recovering quickly, increasing at an average rate of 281% per quarter since Q2 2021. Higher onboard spending is partly fueling this recovery since passengers are boarding with “fresh wallets” & many are more willing to splurge on their vacations. 🛳️ Even though 2022 EoY ticket sales were still not at pre-pandemic levels, in Q1 2023 $CCL reported $1.56B from onboard spending - up $100M from Q1 2019. Another bullish sign is recovering passenger numbers... 📈 $CCL announced record booking volume in Q1 2023, bringing in 2.7 million passengers this quarter (just 200k shy of Q1 2019). $CCL CEO Weinstein reported that $CCL was over 70% booked for the remainder of the year but it will need to surpass 12.8M passengers in 2023 to beat 2019’s record. $CCL also has a seasonal catalyst on the way....🌊 To illustrate how important the summer season is for cruise lines, in Q3 2018 $CCL realized $5.83B in  revenues -  $1.6B more than it made in Q1. In Q3 2019, $CCL made  $6.53B in revenues - $1.86B than it had in Q1 of that year. $CCL expects to close its occupancy gap with 2019, & a combination of higher passenger numbers & ticket prices could be the tailwind needed for $CCL to report very strong Q3 earnings this year... But $CCL does face some long-term risks...⚠️ $CCL is weighed down with debt & the deleveraging process which will likely take longer than expected. With $8B in liquidity, $CCL plans to pay down near-term debt maturities of $1.8B for the remainder of 2023 - leaving its long-term debt at almost $33.5 billion. Right now, Carnival's management team is focused on getting CCL’s credit back to investment grade & has no plans to issue equity. According to its guidance, $CCL is working towards 100% occupancy & $4.4B EBITDA in 2023 To find out more about $CCL and its competitor $NCLH which will report its Q1 2023 earnings on May 9th check out our article: https://t.co/dJPesQSZ3u",0.13396801054477692,0.828517496585846,0.03751450404524803
