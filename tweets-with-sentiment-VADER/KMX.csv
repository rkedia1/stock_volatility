In comparison, the company had earnings of $0.98 per share a year ago. These figures have been adjusted for non-recurring items. In the previous quarter, CarMax was expected to post earnings of $0.58 per share but reported $0.24, resulting in a surprise of -58.62%. üìà - Boeing's, $BA, aircraft deliveries surged as airlines anticipate new jets to cater to the rebound in travel demand. In March, the company delivered 64 planes to customers, marking its highest number since December. Boeing resumed 787 Dreamliner handovers in mid-March after resolving a data analysis flaw. Furthermore, the manufacturer is set to increase production of its popular narrow-body and wide-body jets. - Alphabet's, $GOOGL,  late-stage venture capital arm, CapitalG, has led a $100 million investment in corporate data firm AlphaSense, raising the company's valuation to $1.8 billion. AlphaSense rivals firms such as FactSet and Bloomberg, offering data on businesses to support corporate and investment strategies. The funding round was announced on Tuesday, showcasing Alphabet's commitment to investing in the AI startup ecosystem. My Positions & Plays üí° - I opened a position yesterday in $NVDA $200 P 05/19 with an average of .76. They are currently going for .70. Nivida is highly overbought and overvalued, combine that with insider selling and economic downturns, and I expect this thing to crash significantly in the next couple of months. That is why I opened this position. Please set a tight SL if you do not want to risk your money. I am going to ride this through for the most part. I will update the changes on the play here on Twitter. üí°  - Palantir, $PLTR still makes up most of my long-term portfolio at an average of $15.24.
